  abstract = {{JSON} Schema is a schema language for {JSON} documents, based on a complex combination of structural operators, Boolean operators (negation included), and recursive variables. The static analysis of {JSON} Schema documents comprises practically relevant problems, including schema satisfiability, inclusion, and equivalence. These problems can be reduced to witness generation: given a schema, generate an element of the schema --- if it exists --- and report failure otherwise. Schema satisfiability, inclusion, and equivalence have been shown to be decidable. However, no witness generation algorithm has yet been formally described. We contribute a first, direct algorithm for {JSON} Schema witness generation, and study its effectiveness and efficiency in experiments over several schema collections, including thousands of real-world schemas.},

  abstract  = {Node.js is considered by many as a game-changer—the biggest shift of the decade
               in web development. It is loved not just for its technical capabilities, but also for the
               change of paradigm that it introduced in web development.
               First, Node.js applications are written in {JavaScript}, the language of the web, the
               only programming language supported natively by a majority of web browsers.
               This aspect only enables scenarios such as single-language application stacks and
               sharing of code between the server and the client. Node.js itself is contributing to
               the rise and evolution of the {JavaScript} language. People realize that using {JavaScript}
               on the server is not as bad as it is in the browser, and they will soon start to love it
               for its pragmatism and for its hybrid nature, half way between object-oriented and
               functional programming.
               The second revolutionizing factor is its single-threaded, asynchronous architecture.
               Besides obvious advantages from a performance and scalability point of view,
               this characteristic changed the way developers approach concurrency and
               parallelism. Mutexes are replaced by queues, threads by callbacks and events,
               and synchronization by causality.
               The last and most important aspect of Node.js lies in its ecosystem: the npm package
               manager, its constantly growing database of modules, its enthusiastic and helpful
               community, and most importantly, its very own culture based on simplicity,
               pragmatism, and extreme modularity.},
