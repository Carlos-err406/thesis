    \begin{abstract}
        This thesis develops an open-source web application for Active Directory management through LDAP with Samba4 as domain controller, addressing limitations in existing solutions like ADWebmanager. The research establishes a theoretical foundation for centralized user management and directory services, analyzing current tools and technologies. The proposed solution implements a complete domain model with layered architecture, using SvelteKit and ldapts for AD integration.

        The application provides robust LDAP client functionality, responsive user interface, and comprehensive user management flows. Key features include automated deployment through CI/CD and Docker containers, along with automatically generated technical documentation. Testing methodologies included unit and integration tests with Vitest, and E2E tests with Playwright, validating all critical operations.

        Results demonstrate successful implementation of core functionalities, including resource creation, modification, and deletion. The solution offers significant improvements in flexibility, security, and ease of use compared to existing tools. This work contributes to the field of user and directory management by establishing a framework for future research and development.

        The thesis concludes that the proposed solution provides a valuable alternative for organizations seeking to enhance their identity management systems, particularly in environments requiring high levels of customization and security.
