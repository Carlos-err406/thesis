        This thesis presents an open-source web application for user management and authentication based on Active Directory through LDAP. The solution addresses limitations of its predecessors by offering a centralized administration console that is both highly configurable and adaptable to organizational needs. The development followed a systematic approach, including requirements analysis, technology selection, and implementation of core functionalities.

        Key aspects include robust LDAP client integration, responsive user interface, and user management flows. The application demonstrates significant advantages in terms of flexibility and ease of use compared to its predecessors. Testing results confirm the viability of the approach, with successful implementation of critical features.

        This work contributes to the field of user and directory management by establishing a framework for future research and development. The proposed solution positions itself as a valuable alternative for organizations seeking to enhance their identity management in an evolving digital landscape.
